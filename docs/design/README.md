**NOTE** The diagrams are done using [Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid), which is a project for writing diagrams in "text" form.

**DEVELOPMENT** If your design requires a "feature" which Mermaid does not have, you are probably either a) over-engineering or b) doing it wrong ;)

The design docs names, which are named like semantic versions, are not reflecting the project version/release they appear nor being implemented in.
