## Flow

![v00 Flows Goals](v00/flow-goals.mmd.png)

## API

GRPC.
So far I'm happy with GRPC. Even though there are some limitations in point of `repeated` keyword.

## What do we need?

* Facts from nodes.
* Templating for files (e.g., Config file templating).
* Syncronizing tasks (e.g., serialization (X nodes at a time), all nodes need to complete task before continuing).
* Actions/Tasks (modules) to be able to run (e.g., a command can be run).
* Syncing a variable / file (e.g., token, certificate) between one or more nodes (1 to many).

## Objects

### Global Objects

* `NodeGroups`
    * "A list of nodes".
    * Label selectors for Nodes.
    * Or just a plain list of Nodes (not recommended).
* `Nodes`
    * Servers the management daemon is running on.
* `Configs`
    * Configuration for e.g., management daemon, data store and defaults for action/task runs.
* `ClusterVariables`
    * Global Variables are either defined for a single server a NodeGroup(s).
    * _Types_:
        * Static
        * Dynamically "calculated", meaning Actions/Tasks can be run and also other variables can be "combined".
* `ClusterEvents`
    * Events which are affecting the whole cluster.
    * Can be actual a data store is "broken" event or also events from a single node.

### Namespaced Objects

* `TaskBooks`
    * Contains actions/tasks in a grouped/collection manner.
	* But can also "just" contain one or more "links" to git repositories containing actions/tasks.
* `Variables`
    * Variables are either defined for a single server a `NodeGroups`.
    * Can be static or dynamically "calculated".
* `CronJobs`
    * Action(s)/Task(s) to be run by a defined schedule.
    * Can also point to one or more `TaskBooks`.
* `Beacons`
    * "Checks" which can be periodically run and then in return trigger an `Events`.
* `Triggers`
    * Trigger definitions with time and count conditions.
* `Events`
    * Events which are affecting the namespace they are in.
    * _Examples_:
        * Action/Task has been run.
        * `TaskBook` run has completed.
        * "Check/Monitor" events: Like Salt `Beacons`.

## Objects Structure

### Object Metadata

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Config
name: object-name
# If the object is nameespaced a namespace must be set.
namespace: example123
labels:
  label-1: label-1-value
annotations:
  my-annotation-1: annotation-1-value
# The UUID is set by the "master".
uuid: 5acfcdce-be46-4f34-81be-9fd6980c2224
```
