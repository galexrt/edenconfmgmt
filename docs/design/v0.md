## Environment Assumptions

These are the assumptions of the general environment where one would use this project/tool.

* (Always) at least 3 or more servers.
* All user given "state" code is in one or more git repositories.
* Network is "unsecure"/public/untrusted.
    * Connections to servers using SSH are considered secure.

## Goals

* SSH CA used for server authentication to establish initial trust.
    * After that a certificate is generated to secure the traffic between all nodes.
        * NOTE: This kind of sounds like it is the perfect opportunity to use Wireguard.
* If a node fails which is currently a datastore, the cluster can continue to work.
    * An existing node that is eligible to be a datastore will take over the datastore role.
* Running a "state" allows another "state" to use it and/or it's output as a variable.
* `require` and `require_in` and so on from Saltstack are correctly identified and applied to the ordering.
    * NOTE: There will be different ordering modes, e.g.:
        - "justdoit" mode which does not do any ordering (except `require`, etc are respected) and just fires all others at once.
        - "ansible" mode which does execute one task after another, respecting `require`, etc.
        - `genius` mode which does "complex" ordering and optimization (e.g., add a repo first and then run `dnf update`).
            - **Will probably not be a thing in the _zero_ (first) version**
* There are some simple default modules.
    * Planned:
        * `cmd`
    * Future:
        * `pkg` (PackageKit ?)
        * `pkgrepo` (PackageKit ?)
* Extension modules can be copied from the datastore or an "external" source, and be verified.
