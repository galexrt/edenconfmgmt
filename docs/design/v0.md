### Environment Assumptions

These are the assumptions of the general environment where one would use this project/tool.

* At least 3 servers.
* All user given "state" code is in git repository.
* Network is "unsecure"/public/untrusted.
    * Connections using SSH are considered secure.

### Goals

* SSH CA used for server authentication to establish initial trust.
    * After that GPG is used for encrypt/decrypt.
* If a node fails which is currently a datastore, the cluster can continue to work.
* Extension modules can be copied from the datastore or an "external" source, and be verified.
* Running a "state" allows another "state" to use it and/or it's output as a variable.

### Action Flow

**TODO** This diagram needs to be updated to fit the [Assumptions](#assumptions).
