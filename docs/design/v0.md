## Software to solve problems aka "Evaluate all them software"

Aka list of software and/or decisions to be evaluated/made.

- [ ] Detect software/node failures
    - [ ] Custom implementation (using HTTP; "based" on [hashicorp/memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist))
- [x] Key Value store
    - [x] [coreos/etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd)
- [x] Event distribution
    - [x] [coreos/etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd)
- [ ] Modules
    - [ ] File handling
    - [ ] Package handling
        - [ ] PackageKit
        - [ ] Alternatives?
    - [ ] Command Executor
        - [ ] Golang native lib

## Environment Assumptions

These are the assumptions of the general environment where one would use this project/tool.

* (Always) at least 3 or more servers.
* All user given "state" code is in one or more git repositories.
* Network is "unsecure"/public/untrusted.
    * Connections to servers using SSH are considered secure.

## Goals

* If a node fails which is currently a datastore, the cluster can continue to work.
    * An existing node that is eligible to be a datastore will take over the datastore role.
* Running a "state" allows another "state" to use it and/or it's output as a variable.
* `require` and `require_in` and so on from Saltstack are correctly identified and applied to the ordering.
    * NOTE: There will be different ordering modes, e.g.:
        - "justdoit" mode which does not do any ordering (except `require`, etc are respected) and just fires all others at once.
        - "ansible" mode which does execute one task after another, respecting `require`, etc.
        - `genius` mode which does "complex" ordering and optimization (e.g., add a repo first and then run `dnf update`).
            - **Will probably not be a thing in the _zero_ (first) version**
* There are some simple default modules.
    * Planned:
        * `cmd`
    * Future:
        * `pkg` (PackageKit ?)
        * `pkgrepo` (PackageKit ?)
* Extension modules can be copied from the datastore or an "external" source, and be verified.
